We are trying to find a statistic called xG (Expected Goals) which is used to find the positions of a football field from where the chances of scoring goals are maximum. We have used various Machine Learning Models to find the features and finally create a model to predict the xG at a particular location.
The results are displayed in a gist on the jpeg file at the beginning.
